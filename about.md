I recently worked as a Data Analyst in NSW Data Analytics Centre under the NSW Department of Customer Service. I have been involved in several analytics projects by developing the data engineering pipeline, performing exploratory data analysis, and building predictive models using programming languages such as Python (especially PySpark) and R. I was exposed in a wide range of analytics projects, including scoring or benchmarking, route optimisation, privacy-preserving data sharing, and linear regression. I have experiences in building dashboard and data visualisation using Tableau, Power BI, Plotly, and Shiny.

I am passionate about finding insights and patterns to create meaningful value from available data. If you present me with a data analysis project, I will approach the machine learning modelling problem from a statistical background or neural network based on the business need.
